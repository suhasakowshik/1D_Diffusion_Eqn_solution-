# 1D_Unsteady_Diffusion_Eqn_solution

1D unsteady diffusion Equation solution with periodic boundary conditions and domain error calculation

domain errors are calculated using analytical solution to the equation at each timestep 

file oneD.cpp gives calculates solutions and gives file output

PlotsGraph.m (matlab file) plots the data
